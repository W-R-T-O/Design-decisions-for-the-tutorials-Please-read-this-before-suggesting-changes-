# Contribution guide

We appreciate your thought to contribute to open source. :heart:

If you'd like to suggest a change in the tutorials or the workflow, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/issues/new). We can have a discussion to better understand the problem, get more people involved and make a collective decision.

If you're making changes to a translation, please request a review from our previous contributors who has translated to the respective translation. Our goal is for all translations to have the same content as the English one (`Readme.md`) (Except for links to other translations. We realised that it doesn't add much value)

### Our reviewers :sparkles:
