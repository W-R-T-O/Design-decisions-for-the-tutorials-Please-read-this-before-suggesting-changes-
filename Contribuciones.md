# Contribution guide

We appreciate your thought to contribute to open source. :heart:

If you'd like to suggest a change in the tutorials or the workflow, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/issues/new). We can have a discussion to better understand the problem, get more people involved and make a collective decision.
