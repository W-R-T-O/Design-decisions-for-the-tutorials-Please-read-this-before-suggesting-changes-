## Contribution requirements

Things that will make contributions work well:

1. Activate the [ufoNormalizer](https://github.com/unified-font-object/ufoNormalizer) to use in RoboFont. This will minimize noise in Git commits by keeping the UFO internal code formatting similar.
2. Work in a [feature branch](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) named for the feature/fixes you are working on, e.g. `powerline-glyphs`.

(More suggestions will be added over time.)
